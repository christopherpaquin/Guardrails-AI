git checkout -b fix/bug-description

# 2. Reproduce bug with test (if possible)
[guidance on test location]

# 3. Fix bug
[specific guidance]

# 4. Verify fix
[your test command]

# 5. Run checks

## 5. Code Style and Standards

### Language-Specific Guidelines

- [Key conventions, e.g., naming, file organization]
- [Linting tool and config location]
- [Formatting tool and config location]

**[Language 2]:**
- [Key conventions]
- [Tools used]

### Pre-commit Checks

**Automatically enforced:**
- Code formatting
- Linting
- Secret detection
- [Project-specific checks]

**Run manually before committing:**
```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

**Managing pre-commit hooks:**
```bash
# List all hooks
./scripts/manage-precommit-hooks.sh list

# Disable expensive check during dev
./scripts/manage-precommit-hooks.sh disable [hook-id]

# Re-enable before committing
./scripts/manage-precommit-hooks.sh enable [hook-id]
```

## 6. Git Workflow

### Branch Naming Convention

```text
feature/description   - New features
fix/description       - Bug fixes
docs/description      - Documentation only
refactor/description  - Code refactoring
test/description      - Adding/updating tests
chore/description     - Maintenance tasks
```

### Commit Message Format

```text
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

**Examples:**
```text
feat(auth): Add OAuth2 login support
fix(api): Handle null response in user endpoint
docs(readme): Update installation instructions
```

**CRITICAL - Never commit secrets in messages!**
