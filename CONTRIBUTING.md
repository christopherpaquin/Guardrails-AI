# Contributing Guide

This repository provides AI coding assistant guardrails for software engineering projects.
Contributors (both human and AI) must follow these standards.

## 🤖 For AI Coding Assistants

### Quick Start

**You MUST read these files first:**
1. **`CLAUDE.md`** (if you're Claude) - Your operational guardrails
2. **`.cursor/rules/*.mdc`** (if you're Cursor) - Scoped, prioritized rules
3. **`CONTEXT.md`** - Canonical standards document

### Critical Requirements

#### 1. Security (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

**NEVER commit secrets:**
- API keys, tokens, passwords, credentials
- Private keys (`.pem`, `.key`, SSH keys)
- Cloud provider credentials
- ANY authentication material

**How to handle secrets:**
- ✅ Store in `.env` files (gitignored)
- ✅ Provide `.env.example` with placeholders
- ✅ Load from environment in code
- ❌ NEVER hardcode in source code
- ❌ NEVER log or print secret values

#### 2. Pre-commit Checks (MANDATORY)

ALL commits must pass pre-commit:

```bash
# Run before every commit
./scripts/run-precommit.sh

# Or if that doesn't exist
pre-commit run --all-files
```

**Never bypass**: `--no-verify` is forbidden.

#### 3. Coding Standards

**Bash:**
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
# Quote all variables: "${VAR}"
```

**Python:**
```python
def function_name(arg: str) -> bool:
    """Include type hints and docstrings."""
    pass
```

**YAML:**
- Use `.yaml` extension (never `.yml`)
- 2-space indentation
- `snake_case` keys

**JSON:**
- 2-space indentation
- No trailing commas
- No comments

#### 4. Documentation

When changing code, update:
- README.md (if user-facing changes)
- Relevant docs/ files
- Inline comments (explain WHY, not WHAT)

## 👥 For Human Contributors

### Setup Your Environment

#### 1. Install Prerequisites

```bash
# Python 3.11+ required
python3 --version

# Install pre-commit
pip install pre-commit
```

#### 2. Clone and Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repo-url>
cd Guardrails-AI

# Install pre-commit hooks (REQUIRED)
pre-commit install
pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg

# Verify setup
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Development Workflow

#### 1. Before Making Changes

- Read relevant `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` files
- Check `CONTEXT.md` for detailed standards
- Understand the existing patterns

#### 2. Making Changes

- Follow coding standards strictly
- Test your changes thoroughly
- Update documentation

#### 3. Before Committing

```bash
# Run quality checks
pre-commit run --all-files

# Fix any issues
# Many are auto-fixed - run again after

# Commit only when all checks pass
git add <files>
git commit -m "Clear, descriptive message"
```

#### 4. Creating Pull Requests

- Ensure all CI checks pass
- Provide clear description of changes
- Link to related issues
- Include test results if applicable

### Quality Gates

This repository enforces quality through:

| Gate | What It Checks | When It Runs |
|------|----------------|--------------|
| **Pre-commit (local)** | Formatting, linting, secrets | Before commit |
| **Commit-msg hook** | Message validation | On commit |
| **CI/CD** | Same checks as pre-commit | On push/PR |
| **Code review** | Logic, design, completeness | On PR |

**All gates must pass** - no exceptions.

## 📋 Coding Standards Summary

### Design Principles

1. ✅ **Correctness over cleverness** - Clear beats clever
2. ✅ **Explicit over implicit** - No assumptions
3. ✅ **Idempotent and safe** - Safe to re-run
4. ✅ **Fail loudly** - Clear errors, early validation
5. ✅ **Maintainable** - Boring, standard solutions

### Security Checklist

Before committing ANY file:
- [ ] Contains no secrets or credentials
- [ ] Secrets are in `.env` (gitignored)
- [ ] Provided `.env.example` with placeholders
- [ ] Checked `.gitignore` for file type
- [ ] No hardcoded paths or credentials

### Code Quality Checklist

- [ ] Bash: Has `set -euo pipefail`, quotes variables
- [ ] Python: Has type hints, docstrings
- [ ] YAML: Uses `.yaml`, 2-space indent
- [ ] JSON: 2-space indent, no trailing commas
- [ ] Comments explain WHY, not WHAT
- [ ] Error messages are clear and actionable

### Documentation Checklist

- [ ] README.md updated (if needed)
- [ ] Relevant docs/ files updated
- [ ] Usage examples provided
- [ ] Breaking changes documented

## 🔍 Code Review Guidelines

### What Reviewers Look For

1. **Security**
   - No secrets in code
   - Proper input validation
   - Safe file handling

2. **Quality**
   - Follows coding standards
   - Has appropriate tests
   - Clear, maintainable code

3. **Documentation**
   - Changes are documented
   - Usage examples provided
   - Breaking changes called out

4. **Completeness**
   - All edge cases handled
   - Error handling appropriate
   - Idempotent and safe

### Review Etiquette

- Be constructive and specific
- Explain the "why" behind suggestions
- Acknowledge good work
- Focus on the code, not the person

## 📚 Learning Resources

- **`.cursor/rules/*.mdc`** - Detailed coding standards with examples
- **`CONTEXT.md`** - Complete canonical standards
- **`CLAUDE.md`** - AI assistant instructions (good for humans too!)
- **`.pre-commit-config.yaml`** - See what quality checks run

---

## ❓ Questions or Help?

- Check existing documentation first
- Review `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` for examples
- Look at existing code for patterns
- Ask in issues or discussions

---

## 🎯 TL;DR

For AI assistants:
1. Read `CLAUDE.md` or `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`
2. Never commit secrets
3. Run pre-commit before commits
4. Follow coding standards

For humans:
1. Install pre-commit: `pip install pre-commit && pre-commit install`
2. Run checks before commits: `pre-commit run --all-files`
3. Follow coding standards in `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`
4. Update documentation with code changes

**Quality and security are non-negotiable. All checks must pass.**
