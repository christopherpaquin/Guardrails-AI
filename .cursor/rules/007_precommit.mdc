# Pre-commit Workflow

## Mandatory Quality Gate

Pre-commit is **NOT OPTIONAL**. All commits must pass quality checks.

## Setup (One-time)

```bash
# Install pre-commit
pip install pre-commit

# Install hooks (REQUIRED)
pre-commit install
pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg
```

## Before Every Commit

Run pre-commit to check your changes:

```bash
# If scripts/run-precommit.sh exists, use it
./scripts/run-precommit.sh

# Otherwise, run pre-commit directly
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## What Pre-commit Checks

Typical checks include:
- ✅ Formatting (Python, Shell, YAML, JSON, Markdown)
- ✅ Linting (Code quality, style violations)
- ✅ Security (Secret detection, private keys)
- ✅ File integrity (Symlinks, executables, line endings)
- ✅ Git hygiene (Merge conflicts, large files)

## Workflow

```bash
# 1. Make changes
vim myfile.py

# 2. Run pre-commit
./scripts/run-precommit.sh

# 3. Fix any issues
# Pre-commit often auto-fixes them

# 4. Run again if files were modified
./scripts/run-precommit.sh

# 5. Commit when all checks pass
git add myfile.py
git commit -m "Add feature X"
```

## Auto-fixes

Many hooks auto-fix issues:
- Trailing whitespace removal
- EOF fixing
- JSON/YAML formatting
- Import sorting

**After auto-fixes, run pre-commit again!**

## If Pre-commit Fails

1. Read the error message carefully
2. Check `artifacts/pre-commit.log` for details
3. Fix the issues
4. Run pre-commit again
5. Repeat until all checks pass

## Never Skip Pre-commit

❌ **NEVER use** `git commit --no-verify`
❌ **NEVER disable** pre-commit hooks
❌ **NEVER bypass** quality checks

**Why:**
- CI runs the same checks - they'll fail anyway
- Saves time by catching issues early
- Maintains code quality and security

## CI Enforcement

Even if you skip pre-commit locally (don't!), CI will:
- Run ALL the same checks
- Block PR merges if checks fail
- Upload failure logs for review

**Bottom line: Pre-commit checks are mandatory.**
