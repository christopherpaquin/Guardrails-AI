# Repository: AI Guardrails for Engineering Projects

## Purpose

This repository provides AI coding assistant configurations and guardrails for
software engineering projects. It contains tool-specific instructions (Cursor, Claude,
GitHub Copilot, etc.) derived from a canonical set of engineering standards.

## IMPORTANT: Read WORKLOG.md First

**Before starting any work, read `WORKLOG.md`** to understand recent implementation
work, decisions made, and approaches that didn't work. This prevents circular work
and maintains context across agent sessions.

**After completing significant work, update `WORKLOG.md`** with:
- Features added (brief description)
- Findings and decisions (why certain approaches were chosen)
- What doesn't work (failed approaches to avoid re-trying)

Keep entries brief (1-3 lines each). This maintains continuity and prevents
repeating failed experiments.

## Key Characteristics

- **Governance-first approach**: Documentation as executable instructions
- **Defense-in-depth security**: Never commit secrets (3-layer protection)
- **Quality gates**: Pre-commit hooks, CI/CD enforcement
- **Tool-native configs**: Optimized for each AI assistant
- **Single source of truth**: All configs derived from CONTEXT.md

## Usage

Include this repository in your projects:

```bash
# As a git submodule
git submodule add <repo-url> .ai-guardrails

# Or copy files directly
cp -r .ai-guardrails/.cursor .
cp -r .ai-guardrails/CLAUDE.md .
cp -r .ai-guardrails/CONTRIBUTING.md .
```
