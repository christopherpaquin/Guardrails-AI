# Implementation Work Log

**Purpose:** Track features added, implementation decisions, and findings to prevent circular work and maintain context for new AI agents.

**Instructions for AI Agents:**
- Update this file whenever you add features, make significant changes, or discover important findings
- Keep entries brief (1-3 lines per item)
- Focus on WHAT was done and WHY certain approaches work or don't work
- Date entries for chronological tracking

## 2026-02-08

### Features Added
- Created `WORKLOG.md` to track AI agent implementation work and prevent circular debugging
- Created `WORKLOG_USAGE.md` with comprehensive usage guide (examples, workflow, best practices)
- Updated bootstrap script (`template/bootstrap-guardrails.sh`) to deploy WORKLOG.md to new projects
- Updated all major documentation files to reference WORKLOG.md:
  - `AGENTS.md` (section 2.1 with workflow instructions)
  - `CLAUDE.md` (prominent section after "Your Role")
  - `.cursor/rules/001_workspace.mdc` (workspace context)
  - `README.md` (documentation section and quick start)
  - `QUICK_START.md` (AI context files and documentation table)
  - `CONTRIBUTING.md` (AI and human workflows, checklists)
  - `template/USAGE.md` (new section on implementation tracking)
  - `AI_TOOL_CONFIGURATIONS.md` (new universal format entry)

### Findings & Decisions
- `CONTEXT.md` is for standards (HOW to code), not implementation tracking (WHAT was built)
- AI agents reference CONTEXT.md, AGENTS.md, and CLAUDE.md reliably - confirmed in multiple config files
- Worklog should be separate from standards documentation for clarity
- Bootstrap script now creates basic WORKLOG.md if template not found (fallback for robustness)
- Manual user workflow is intentional - prompting agents to update keeps humans in control

### What Doesn't Work
- _(None yet - document failed approaches here to save future time)_

## 2026-02-08 (Later)

### Features Added
- Created comprehensive documentation page for Project Context Tracking feature (`docs/project-context-tracking.html`)
- Added new bento box to website features grid highlighting WORKLOG.md
- Updated Quick Start section to include copying WORKLOG.md and WORKLOG_USAGE.md files
- Added WORKLOG Guide link to footer documentation resources

### Findings & Decisions
- Documentation page explains both the problem (context loss) and solution (dual approach with manual prompting + auto reminders)
- Used amber/orange color scheme for the new bento box to make it visually distinct
- Structured doc page with problem boxes, solution boxes, and comparison grids for clarity
- Included workflow diagram showing the complete implementation tracking cycle
- Page covers: problem statement, solution approach, WORKLOG vs CONTEXT comparison, entry format, dual approach, examples, benefits

### What Doesn't Work
- _(None yet - documentation approach successful on first implementation)_

## Template for Future Entries

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD

### Features Added
- Feature or change description

### Findings & Decisions
- Important discoveries or decisions made
- Why certain approaches were chosen

### What Doesn't Work
- Approaches that were tried but failed
- Saves time by preventing re-attempts
```

## Usage Examples

### Good Entry Example
```markdown
## 2026-02-10

### Features Added
- Added pre-commit hook for secret detection using detect-secrets library
- Created management script `manage-precommit-hooks.sh` for enable/disable functionality

### Findings & Decisions
- detect-secrets baseline approach rejected - too manual, requires user intervention
- Pattern-based scanning with entropy analysis works better for automation
- Script must return non-zero exit code to properly fail pre-commit

### What Doesn't Work
- ❌ Using `git secrets` tool - doesn't support custom patterns well
- ❌ Storing secrets baseline in repo - causes merge conflicts
```

### Bad Entry Example (Too Vague)
```markdown
## 2026-02-10
- Fixed some stuff
- Updated files
```

## Notes

- This file is intended for AI agents AND human developers
- Keep it current - stale logs are useless
- When starting a new agent session, read this file first to understand recent work
- If the file gets too large (>500 lines), archive old entries to `WORKLOG_ARCHIVE.md`
